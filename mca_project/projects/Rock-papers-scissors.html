    <h2>What is a Rock Paper Scissors Game?</h2>
    <p>Rock Paper Scissors is a simple hand game that is typically played between two people. Each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with their hand: Rock, Paper, or Scissors. The outcome is determined by the following rules:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Rock beats Scissors</li>
      <li>Scissors beats Paper</li>
      <li>Paper beats Rock</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The game is often used to make decisions or settle disputes, but it can also be a fun game to play online with friends or random opponents.</p>

    <h2>Key Features of a Rock Paper Scissors Game Website</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Interactive Gameplay:</strong> Users should be able to click on Rock, Paper, or Scissors to play against the computer.</li>
      <li><strong>Visual Feedback:</strong> After the player chooses, the computer should randomly select its option and display the winner.</li>
      <li><strong>Game Score:</strong> Track the number of rounds won by the player and the computer.</li>
      <li><strong>Easy to Understand Interface:</strong> Simple buttons or icons representing Rock, Paper, and Scissors for a smooth user experience.</li>
      <li><strong>Sound Effects (Optional):</strong> Adding sound effects for each choice can make the game more engaging.</li>
      <li><strong>Responsive Design:</strong> The game should work well on both desktop and mobile devices.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps to Create a Rock Paper Scissors Game Website</h2>

    <h3>1. Structure of HTML</h3>
    <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is used to create the structure of the website. The main elements will include buttons for selecting Rock, Paper, or Scissors, a display for showing the outcome of the game, and a score tracker.</p>
    <p><strong>Example Structure:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Header:</strong> Contains the title of the game (e.g., "Rock Paper Scissors Game") and basic navigation if needed.</li>
      <li><strong>Game Area:</strong> The section where the user can select Rock, Paper, or Scissors. This can include buttons or images of the hand gestures.</li>
      <li><strong>Result Display:</strong> Shows the result of the round (e.g., "You Win!", "Computer Wins!", or "It's a Tie!").</li>
      <li><strong>Score Display:</strong> Tracks the number of rounds won by the player and the computer.</li>
      <li><strong>Footer:</strong> Optional information, such as credits or game instructions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Styling with CSS</h3>
    <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) will be used to style the game elements and layout. The design should be minimal yet engaging, with a focus on simplicity and ease of use.</p>
    <p><strong>Key CSS Elements for Rock Paper Scissors Game:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Buttons/Icons:</strong> Style the buttons (or images) for Rock, Paper, and Scissors to make them visually distinct and easy to click on.</li>
      <li><strong>Game Area:</strong> Center the game area on the screen and ensure that it looks good on different screen sizes using media queries.</li>
      <li><strong>Result Section:</strong> Use larger text or vibrant colors to make the result of the game (win, lose, tie) stand out.</li>
      <li><strong>Score Display:</strong> Position the score at the top or bottom of the game area, ensuring it's always visible.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. JavaScript for Game Logic</h3>
    <p>JavaScript will handle the logic of the game: determining the winner of each round, updating the score, and displaying the results. It will also randomly generate the computer's choice of Rock, Paper, or Scissors.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Player's Choice:</strong> The player's selection is captured when they click a button or icon.</li>
      <li><strong>Computer's Choice:</strong> The computer randomly picks Rock, Paper, or Scissors using JavaScript's <code>Math.random()</code> function.</li>
      <li><strong>Determining the Winner:</strong> The game compares the player's choice and the computer's choice, and updates the result.</li>
      <li><strong>Updating the Score:</strong> Keep track of the number of rounds won by the player and the computer. This can be done by incrementing variables that hold the score.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Sound Effects (Optional)</h3>
    <p>To make the game more immersive, consider adding sound effects when the player makes a selection, or when a round is won. This can be done using the <code>Audio</code> object in JavaScript.</p>

    <h3>5. Mobile Responsiveness</h3>
    <p>Since many users may play the game on mobile devices, it's important to ensure that the game layout is responsive. Use CSS media queries to adjust the layout and button sizes for smaller screens.</p>

    <h3>6. Optional Features</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Timer:</strong> Add a timer to limit how long the user has to make a selection.</li>
      <li><strong>Multiplayer Mode:</strong> Allow users to play against another person in a local multiplayer mode.</li>
      <li><strong>Game Themes:</strong> Offer different themes or skins for the game to make it more visually interesting.</li>
    </ul>
