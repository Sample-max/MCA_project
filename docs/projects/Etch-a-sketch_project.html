    <h1>Etch-a-Sketch Overview</h1>
    <p>Learn how to create an interactive Etch-a-Sketch website that replicates the classic drawing toy.</p>
  </header>

  <div class="project-details">
    <h2>Etch-a-Sketch Website</h2>
    <p>The Etch-a-Sketch website is a web-based version of the classic toy that allows users to draw freehand on a digital canvas. The project aims to recreate the nostalgic experience of the Etch-a-Sketch while providing additional modern features such as customizable drawing tools and a responsive interface.</p>

    <h3>Key Features</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Interactive Canvas:</strong> Users can draw on the canvas using mouse or touch input. The canvas responds to user movements and allows freehand drawing, much like the original Etch-a-Sketch toy.</li>
      <li><strong>Clear/Reset Function:</strong> A button allows users to clear their drawing and start fresh with a blank canvas. This simulates the ability to shake the toy to erase the drawing.</li>
      <li><strong>Customizable Drawing Tools:</strong> Users can change the drawing color and adjust the thickness of the lines. This adds flexibility to the drawing experience, allowing for a variety of artistic styles.</li>
      <li><strong>Responsive Design:</strong> The website is designed to work seamlessly across different devices, including desktop, tablet, and mobile. The canvas and buttons automatically adjust to fit different screen sizes.</li>
      <li><strong>Save and Share:</strong> Users can save their artwork as an image file (e.g., PNG or JPEG) and share it with others. This feature enables users to keep and share their creations.</li>
      <li><strong>Undo/Redo Functionality:</strong> Users can undo or redo their last actions, giving them more control over their drawing process.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps to Create</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>HTML Structure:</strong> Create a simple structure for the page with a <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element where the drawing will take place. Include buttons for resetting the canvas, adjusting the color, changing the line thickness, and saving the drawing.</li>
      <li><strong>CSS Styling:</strong> Style the page to make the drawing area centered and visually appealing. The canvas should have a border, and buttons should be easy to click. Use CSS media queries to make the website responsive, ensuring that it adapts to different screen sizes.</li>
      <li><strong>JavaScript Logic:</strong> Write JavaScript to enable the drawing functionality. This includes setting up event listeners to capture mouse or touch movements on the canvas, implementing the color and thickness customization, and providing functionality to reset the canvas or save the drawing.</li>
      <li><strong>Canvas API:</strong> Use the HTML5 <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element and its JavaScript API to create the drawing experience. Set up a drawing context and use methods such as <code>beginPath()</code>, <code>moveTo()</code>, <code>lineTo()</code>, and <code>stroke()</code> to simulate the drawing process.</li>
      <li><strong>Advanced Features:</strong> Implement features like undo and redo, color picker, and saving the drawing as an image file. These additional features enhance the user experience and make the tool more interactive.</li>
      <li><strong>Accessibility Considerations:</strong> Make sure that the website is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. Ensure that users can interact with the canvas using keyboard shortcuts or assistive technologies, and provide alternative text for images and buttons.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Advanced Features</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Undo and Redo:</strong> Add the ability for users to undo or redo their last drawing action. This functionality is especially useful for users who want to correct a mistake without starting over. The logic can be implemented using an array to store the history of drawing paths and using buttons to navigate through the history.</li>
      <li><strong>Color Picker:</strong> Provide a color picker tool that lets users choose from a wide range of colors to customize their drawings. This can be done by using an input of type <code>color</code> or by creating a custom color palette for users to choose from.</li>
      <li><strong>Adjustable Line Thickness:</strong> Allow users to adjust the thickness of the lines they draw. This can be achieved by adding a slider or a set of buttons that allow users to increase or decrease the thickness of the drawing tool.</li>
      <li><strong>Save Drawing:</strong> Implement a feature that allows users to save their drawing as an image file (PNG or JPEG). You can use the <code>toDataURL()</code> method of the <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element to convert the canvas content into an image format and trigger a download using JavaScript.</li>
      <li><strong>Dark Mode:</strong> Add a toggle that allows users to switch between light and dark modes. This feature is particularly useful for users who prefer a darker interface for drawing, especially during nighttime or in low-light conditions.</li>
      <li><strong>Share Functionality:</strong> Allow users to share their drawings on social media or via a URL link. You can generate a unique URL for each drawing and allow users to share it, or integrate with social media APIs to enable direct sharing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Best Practices and Tips</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Optimize for Performance:</strong> Ensure that the drawing experience is smooth by optimizing the performance of the canvas rendering. Limit the number of redraws, and minimize heavy calculations or DOM manipulations during the drawing process.</li>
      <li><strong>Test Across Devices:</strong> Since the website will be used on various devices, it's important to test it on desktop, tablet, and mobile to ensure a consistent and smooth experience. Pay attention to touch events and screen sizes.</li>
      <li><strong>Provide Clear Instructions:</strong> Include a short tutorial or instructions on how to use the tool. Users should be able to understand how to start drawing, change the color, and clear the canvas easily.</li>
      <li><strong>Provide a Reset Function:</strong> In addition to the "clear" button, allow users to reset the canvas and undo any mistakes. This ensures users don't get frustrated if they make an error and want to start over quickly.</li>
    </ul>
